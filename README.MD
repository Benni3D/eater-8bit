# Ben Eaters 8-bit CPU
I made this project (in Summer 2020 (Covid Year))
to teach myself 

## Architectural Features
- Really simple design
- 16 byte RAM
- 2 8-bit Register (A, B)
- Single 8-bit Bus
- 8-bit output
- Multi-Cycle Design
- Von-Neumann Architecture
- Easily customizable instruction set (microcode_rom.v)
- Turing-Complete (with the default instruction set)

## Tested on
- DE10-Lite FPGA Board (Terasic)

## "Default Stages"
- Fetch (2 cycles)
- Execute (1-6 cycles)
